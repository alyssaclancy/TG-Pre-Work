/*I learned you can also justify content to move the entire grid along the row axis.The values used are
start, end, center, stretch, space-around (equal amount of space on each side, double between as there is before first/after last),
space-between (equal amount of space between and no space at end),
and space-evenly (even space between and at either end)
This is declared on grid containers.
First, the justify-content in main was set to space-between.
When the browser expands, there is a large space between elements but none on the ends.
Then it was set to space-around. There was double the space between as was on either end.
Then it was set to end, which made the grid aligned to the right side of the browser.
Finally, it was set to center, which made the grid remain in the center of the page.*/
