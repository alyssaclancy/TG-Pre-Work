/*Hue is the first number, and refers to angle on the color wheel.
Saturation is the second number, and refers to intensity of the color (saturation increases towards 100%).
Lightness is the third number, and refers to how light or dark a color is (100% is lightest).
Here, the lightness of background color in .midground, the saturation of background color in .foreground, and the hue of the background color in body were all adjusted.
