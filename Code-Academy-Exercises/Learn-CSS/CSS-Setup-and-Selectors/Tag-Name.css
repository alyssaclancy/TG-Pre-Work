/*I learned that tag names in CSS apply the style to all of the elements with that tag in HTML.
Here I added an h1 tag name and included color: maroon; to make the text color of h1 elements in the
HTML file maroon. The attributes are separated by semi-colons and housed between curly brackets following the tag name.*/
