/*The link element must be included in the head to link HTML and CSS files together.
The 3 attributes that must be included are href to point to the CSS path, type to confirm it is a CSS file (text/CSS in this case) ,
and rel to describe the relationship (i.e. stylesheet). The relevant HTML code that was updated in the HTML file is in the comment below.*/
