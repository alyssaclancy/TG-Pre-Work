/*You can use the link to the font page to load the CSS rules for the font to link it directly in CSS instead of using the link tag in HTML.
The rules needed are labeled under a commented out latin and they get pasted into the top of the CSS stylesheet.
This lets you use the @font-face property. There is no code in this section, but the rules under latin are included above.
