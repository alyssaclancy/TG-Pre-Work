/*grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap can put blank space between rows and columns in the grid.
Grid gap uses some of the available space that is otherwise used by rows and columns when fr units are used.
grid-gap can set row and column gap at the same time - the first number is distance between rows and the second is distance between columns. They px values are not separated by any punctuation here.
First, grid-row-gap set 20px between rows and grid-column-gap put 5px between columns.
Then, grid-gap replaced these two lines with one and maintained the same webpage formatting.
