/*The repeat function duplicates the specs for a row or column an indicated number of times.
You can also indicate multiple column/row sizes and those will be repeated in an alternating sequence.
In the grid-template function, the row sizing was replaced with code that used the repeat function to create 3 rows of equal 1fr height.
