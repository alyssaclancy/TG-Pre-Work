/*Grid uses a new sizing unit called fraction (fr). This sizes rows and columns as a fraction of the grid's length/width.
When mixing fr units with other units, the fr represents a fraction of the available space, to prevent content from spilling over the edges of the grid.
Here, the rows were made to take up the same fraction of space.
The middle column was set to 50% of the grid, the first column took 3/4 of the remaining space and the last column took up the last 1/4 of remaining space.
