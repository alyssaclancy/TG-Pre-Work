const chores = ['wash dishes', 'do laundry', 'take out trash'];

chores.push('vacuum', 'sweep');
console.log(chores);


/*The .push() method allows you to add items to the end of an array. This is a destructive array method because it changes the initial array.
Vacuum and sweep now print in array index 3 and 4.*/
