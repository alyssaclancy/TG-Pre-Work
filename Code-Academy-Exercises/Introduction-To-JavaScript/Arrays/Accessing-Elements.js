/*Elements in an array have a numbered position called an index. You can access an individual array element by using its index.
Arrays are 0 indexed, so the count starts at 0 and not 1.
The logs above return the first string in the array, the third string in the array, and the value "undefined" because there is no fourth element in the array.
