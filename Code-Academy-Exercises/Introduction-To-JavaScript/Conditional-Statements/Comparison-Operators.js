/*Comparison operators allow you to compare values for conditional statements. Some noteworthy and less straightforward ones include
=== for is equal to and !== for is not equal to. Comparison operators compare values and evaluate to true or false.
The code above prints "We can eat later!" because hungerLevel>7 returns the value false.
