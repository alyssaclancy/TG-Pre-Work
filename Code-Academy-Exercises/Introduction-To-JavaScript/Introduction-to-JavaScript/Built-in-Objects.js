/*There are objects other than console, like Math (which has more complex mathematical operations like .floor() to round down and .random() to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
line 1 - generates random number 0-1, multiplies by 100 and rounds down to the next integer.
line 2 - rounds 43.8 up to next integer.
line 3 - checks is 2017 is an integer and returns the boolean true
