/*A function declaration can be used to create a function and bind it to an identifier.
The function keyword followed by identifier and curly brackets that contain the function body.
There is a hoisting feature that allows access to a function declaration before they're defined (i.e. you can use the function prior to declaring it in sequence).
Here, two functions were created. They won't be executed until they are referenced in the code.
