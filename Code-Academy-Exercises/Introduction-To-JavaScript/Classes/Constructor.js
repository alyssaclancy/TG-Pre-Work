/*The constructor method is what sets apart a class and an object. JS calls the constructor method to create each new instance of a class.
We capitalize and CamelCase class names, by convention.
The constructor method accepts arguments.
The this keyword is used inside the constructor method
Here I created a class Surgeon that has a constructor with 2 parameters. The properties within were set to equal the input parameters.*/
