/*AJAX enables requests to be made after the initial page load.XHR can also be used to make many kinds of requests
and supports other forms of data.
There is no code in this exercise, but the diagram illustrates that both xhr and url are defined as object/variables,
a block of code executes the response, and then the request is open and the object is sent.
