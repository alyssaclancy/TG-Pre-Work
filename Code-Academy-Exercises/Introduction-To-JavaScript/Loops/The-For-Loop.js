/*The for loop includes an iterator variable.
An initialization starts the loop, stopping condition is evaluated against to break the loop, and iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.
The for loop above starts with a variable at 5 and prints it, increasing by 1, until it equals 10.
The output is:
5
6
7
8
9
10
