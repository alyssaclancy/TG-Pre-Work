/*for...in syntax helps iterate through key-value pairs in objects that aren't ordered.
It will execute a given block of code for each property in an object
The for...in syntax allows you to loop through the elements in the spaceship.crew object to pull the name of the crew member and associate it either with their role or degree.
The output is printed using template literals for readability.*/
