/*ES5 was updated to ES6 for the following reasons:
ES6 is syntactically more similar to other OOP languages.
Readability and economy of code is imrpoved.
Addresses sources of ES5 bugs.
ES6 code is backwards compatible and can be mapped back to ES5.
The above code was translated from ES6 to ES5 - const and let were updated to var and the ES6 string interpolation was
changed to ES5 string interpolation.
