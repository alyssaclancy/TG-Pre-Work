/*Sources of compatibility issues are: A few ES6 features like modules are still not supported by most web browsers.
Some users have not updated to the latest ES6 supported web browser version.
In caniuse, you can enter an ES6 feature and see the percentage of browsers that recognize it. You can also see when each major web browser added support for the keyword.
There is no code in this lesson, but there was a useful demo on how to search caniuse.com.
