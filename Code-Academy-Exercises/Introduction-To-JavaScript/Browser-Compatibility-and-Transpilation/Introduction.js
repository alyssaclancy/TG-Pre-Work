var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

/*Web browsers update every few months to address security vulnerabilities, features, support new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
The following module focuses on how developers address the gap between the new JavaScript syntax that they use and the syntax the browsers recognize.
THe ES6 syntax was quickly adopted, but it was not supported by most web browsers yet, so there were compatibility issues.
caniuse.com and Babel are two tools that can be used to check browser compatibility.
In this lesson, the code provided ran in a fake old browser and displayed multiple syntax errors when run. */
