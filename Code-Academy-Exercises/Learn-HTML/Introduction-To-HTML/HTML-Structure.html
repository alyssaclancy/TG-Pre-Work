  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>

<!--I was introduced to the HTML hierarchy to understand parent/child/sibling/etc. relationships within HTML nesting.
I created a paragraph p that is a child of the div, and a grandchild of the body.-->
